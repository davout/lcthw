            <h1 class="title">Exercise 31: Debugging Code</h1>
            <p>I've already taught you about my awesome debug macros and you've been using
them.  When I debug code I use the <tt class="docutils literal">debug()</tt> macro almost exclusively to
analyze what's going on and track down the problem.  In this exercise I'm going
to teach you the basics of using gdb to inspect a simple program that runs and
doesn't exit.  You'll learn how to use gdb to attach to a running process, stop
it, and see what's happening.  After that I'll give you some little tips and
tricks that you can use with gdb.</p>
<div class="section" id="debug-printing-vs-gdb-vs-valgrind">
<h1>Debug Printing Vs. GDB Vs. Valgrind</h1>
<p>I approach debugging primarily with a &quot;scientific method&quot; style, where I come
up with possible causes and then rule them out or prove they cause the defect.
The problem many programmers have though is their panic and rush to solve a bug
makes them feel like this approach will &quot;slow them down&quot;.  In their rush to
solve they fail to notice that they're really just flailing around and
gathering no useful information.  I find that logging (debug printing) forces
me to solve a bug scientifically and it's also just easier to gather
information in more situations.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I also have these reasons for using debug printing as my
primary debugging tool:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You see an entire tracing of a program's execution with debug printing of variables which lets you
track how things are going wrong.  With gdb you have to place watch and debug statements all over
for every thing you want and it's difficult to get a solid trace of the execution.</li>
<li>The debug prints can stay in the code, and when you need them you can recompile and they come back.
With gdb you have to configure the same information uniquely for every defect you have to hunt down.</li>
<li>It's easier to turn on debug logging on a server that's not working right and then inspect the logs while
it runs to see what's going on.  System administrators know how to handle logging, they don't know how
to use gdb.</li>
<li>Printing things is just easier. Debuggers are always obtuse and weird with their own quirky interface and
inconsistencies.  There's nothing complicated about <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">debug(&quot;Yo,</span> dis right? %d&quot;, my_stuff);</tt>.</li>
<li>Writing debug prints to find a defect forces you to actually analyze the code and use the scientific method.
You can think of a debug usage as, &quot;I hypothesize that the code is broken here.&quot;  Then when you run it
you get your hypothesis tested and if it's not broken then you can move to another part where it could be.
This may seem like it takes longer, but it's actually faster because you go through a process of &quot;differential
diagnosis&quot; and rule out possible causes until you find the real one.</li>
<li>Debug printing works better with unit testing.  You can actually just compile the debugs in all the time
while you work, and when a unit test explodes just go look at the logs any time.  With gdb you'd have to
rerun the unit test under gdb and then trace through it to see what's going on.</li>
<li>With valgrind you get the equivalent of debug prints for many memory related errors, so you don't need to
use something like gdb to find those defects anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all these reasons that I rely on <tt class="docutils literal">debug</tt> over <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt>, I
still use <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> in a few situations and I think you should have any
tool that helps you get your work done.  Sometimes, you just have to connect to
a broken program and poke around.  Or, maybe you've got a server that's
crashing and you can only get at core files to see why.  In these and a few
other cases, gdb is the way to go, and it's always good to have as many tools
as possible to help solve problems.</p>
<p>I then break down when I use gdb vs. valgrind vs. debug printing like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Valgrind is used to catch all memory errors.  I use gdb if valgrind is having problems or if using
valgrind would slow the program down too much.</li>
<li>Print with debug to diagnose and fix defects related to logic or usage.  This amounts to about 90% of the
defects after you start using Valgrind.</li>
<li>Use gdb for the remaining &quot;mystery weird stuff&quot; or emergency situations to gather information.  If Valgrind isn't turning anything
up and I can't even print out the information I need, then I bust out gdb and start poking around.  My use of
gdb in this case is entirely to gather information.  Once I have an idea of what's going on I go back to writing
a unit test to cause the defect, and then do print statements to find out why.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-debugging-strategy">
<h1>A Debugging Strategy</h1>
<p>This process will actually work with any debugging technique you're going to
use, whether that's Valgrind, debug printing, or using a debugger.  I'm going
to describe it in terms of using <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> since it seems people skip this
process the most when using debuggers, but use this for every bug until you
only need it on the very difficult ones.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Start a little text file called <tt class="docutils literal">notes.txt</tt> and use it as a kind of
&quot;lab notes&quot; for ideas, bugs, problems, etc.</li>
<li>Before you use <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt>, write out the bug you're going to fix
and what could be causing it.</li>
<li>For each cause, write out the files and functions where you think
the cause is coming from, or just write that you don't know.</li>
<li>Now start <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> and pick the first possible cause with good
<a class="reference external" href="file:function">file:function</a> possibles and set breakpoints there.</li>
<li>Use <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> to then run the program and confirm if that is the
cause.  The best way is to see if you can use the <tt class="docutils literal">set</tt> command
to either fix the program easily or cause the error immediately.</li>
<li>If this isn't the cause, then mark in the <tt class="docutils literal">notes.txt</tt> that it
wasn't and why.  Move on to the next possible cause that's easiest
to debug, and keep adding information you gather.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you haven't noticed, this is basically the scientific method.  You
write down a set of hypotheses, then you use debugging to prove or disprove
them.  This gives you insight into more possible causes and then eventually you
find it. This process helps you avoid going over the same possible causes
repeatedly even though you've found they aren't possible.</p>
<p>You can also do this with debug printing, the only difference is you actually
write out your hypotheses in the source code where you think the problem is
instead of the <tt class="docutils literal">notes.txt</tt>.  In a way, debug printing forces you to tackle
bugs scientifically since you have to write out hypotheses as print statements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-gdb">
<h1>Using GDB</h1>
<p>The program I'll debug in this exercise is just a while-loop that doesn't
terminate correctly.  I'm putting a small <tt class="docutils literal">usleep</tt> call in it so that
there's something interesting to troll through as well.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><a name="code--ex31.c-pyg.html-1"></a><span class="cp">#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</span>

<a name="code--ex31.c-pyg.html-12"></a><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div><p>Compile this like normal and then start it under <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> like this:  <tt class="docutils literal">gdb ./ex31</tt></p>
<p>Once it's running I want you to play around with these <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> commands
to see what they do and how to use them.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>help COMMAND</dt>
<dd>Get a short help with COMMAND.</dd>
<dt>break file.c:(line|function)</dt>
<dd>Sets a break point where you want to pause execution.  You can give lines or function names to break at after the file.</dd>
<dt>run ARGS</dt>
<dd>Runs the program, using the ARGS as arguments to the program.</dd>
<dt>cont</dt>
<dd>Continues execution until a new breakpoint or error.</dd>
<dt>step</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Step through the code, but move <em>into functions</em>.  Use this to</p>
<p class="last">trace into a function and see what it's doing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>next</dt>
<dd>Just like <tt class="docutils literal">step</tt>, but go <em>over functions</em> by just running them.</dd>
<dt>backtrace (or bt)</dt>
<dd>Does a &quot;backtrace&quot;, which dumps the trace of function
calls leading to the current point in the program. Very useful for figuring
out how you got there, since it also prints the parameters that were passed
to each function.  It's also similar to what Valgrind reports when you have
a memory error.</dd>
<dt>set var X = Y</dt>
<dd>Set variable X equal to Y.</dd>
<dt>print X</dt>
<dd>Prints out the value of X, and you can usually use C syntax to access
the values of pointers and contents of structs.</dd>
<dt>ENTER</dt>
<dd>The ENTER key just repeats the last command.</dd>
<dt>quit</dt>
<dd>Exits <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt></dd>
</dl>
<p>Those are the majority of commands I use with <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt>.  Your job is to
now play with these and <tt class="docutils literal">ex31</tt> so you can get familiar with the output.</p>
<p>Once you're familiar with <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> you'll want to play with it some more.
Try using it on more complicated programs like <tt class="docutils literal">devpkg</tt> to see if you
can alter the program's execution or analyze what it's doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="process-attaching">
<h1>Process Attaching</h1>
<p>The most useful thing about <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> is the ability to attach to a running program and
debug it right there.  When you have a crashing server or a GUI program, you can't
usually start it under <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> like you just did.  Instead, you have to start
it, hope it doesn't crash right away, then attach to it and set a breakpoint.  In
this part of the exercise I'll show you how to do that.</p>
<p>After you exit <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> I want you to restart <tt class="docutils literal">ex31</tt> if you
stopped it, and then start another Terminal window so you can process attach to
it.  Process attaching is where you tell <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> to connect to a program
that's already running so you can inspect it live.  It stops the program and
then you can walk through it, and when you're done it'll continue just like
normal.</p>
<p>Here's a session of me doing it to <tt class="docutils literal">ex31</tt>, stepping through it, then
fixing the while-loop to make it exit.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">On OSX you may see a GUI prompt for the root password, and even after you
give it you still get an error from <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> saying &quot;Unable to access task for process-id XXX: (os/kern) failure.&quot;  In that case stop both gdb and the
<tt class="docutils literal">ex31</tt> program, then start over and it should work as long as you
successfully entered the root password.</p>
</div>
<p>I'll walk through this session and explain what I did:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>gdb:1</dt>
<dd>I use <tt class="docutils literal">ps</tt> to find out what the process id is
of the <tt class="docutils literal">ex31</tt> I want to attach.</dd>
<dt>gdb:5</dt>
<dd>I'm attaching using <tt class="docutils literal">gdb ./ex31 PID</tt> replacing PID with
the process id I have.</dd>
<dt>gdb:6-19</dt>
<dd><tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> prints out a bunch of information about it's
license and then all the things it's reading.</dd>
<dt>gdb:21</dt>
<dd>The program is attached and stopped at this point, so now I set
a breakpoint at line 8 in the file with <tt class="docutils literal">break</tt>.
I'm assuming that I'm already in the file I want to break when I do this.</dd>
<dt>gdb:24</dt>
<dd>A better way to do a <tt class="docutils literal">break</tt>, is give <tt class="docutils literal">file.c:line</tt> format
so you can be sure you did the right location.  I do that in this <tt class="docutils literal">break</tt>.</dd>
<dt>gdb:27</dt>
<dd>I use <tt class="docutils literal">cont</tt> to continue processing until I hit a breakpoint.</dd>
<dt>gdb:30-31</dt>
<dd>The breakpoint is reached so <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> prints out variables
I need to know about (<tt class="docutils literal">argc</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">argv</tt>) and where it's stopped,
then the line of code for the breakpoint.</dd>
<dt>gdb:33-34</dt>
<dd>I use the abbreviation for <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> &quot;p&quot; to print out the value
of the <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> variable.  It's 0.</dd>
<dt>gdb:36</dt>
<dd>Continue again to see if <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> changes.</dd>
<dt>gdb:42</dt>
<dd>Print out <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> again, and nope it's not changing.</dd>
<dt>gdb:45-55</dt>
<dd>Use <tt class="docutils literal">list</tt> to see what the code is, and then I realize
it's not exiting because I'm not incrementing <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>.</dd>
<dt>gdb:57</dt>
<dd>Confirm my hypothesis that <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> needs to change by using the
<tt class="docutils literal">set</tt> command to change it to be <tt class="docutils literal">i = 200</tt>.  This is one of the
best features of <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> as it lets you &quot;fix&quot; a program really quick
to see if you're right.</dd>
<dt>gdb:59</dt>
<dd>Print out <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> just to make sure it changed.</dd>
<dt>gdb:62</dt>
<dd>Use <tt class="docutils literal">next</tt> to move to the next piece of code, and I see that
the breakpoint at <tt class="docutils literal">ex31.c:12</tt> is hit, so that means the while-loop
exited.  My hypothesis is correct, I need to make <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> change.</dd>
<dt>gdb:67</dt>
<dd>Use <tt class="docutils literal">cont</tt> to continue and the program exits like normal.</dd>
<dt>gdb:71</dt>
<dd>I finally use <tt class="docutils literal">quit</tt> to get out of <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt>.</dd>

<h1>GDB Tricks</h1>
<p>Here's a list of simple tricks you can do with GDB:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>gdb --args</dt>
<dd>Normally <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt> takes arguments you give it
and assumes they are for itself.  Using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--args</span></tt> passes them to
the program.</dd>
<dt>thread apply all bt</dt>
<dd>Dumps a backtrace for <em>all</em> threads.  Very useful.</dd>
<dt>gdb --batch --ex r --ex bt --ex q --args</dt>
<dd>Runs the program so that, if it
bombs you get a backtrace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>?</dt>
<dd>Got one? Leave it in the comments.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extra-credit">
<h1>Extra Credit</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Find a graphical debugger and compare using it to raw <tt class="docutils literal">gdb</tt>.
These are useful when the program you're looking at is local, but they
are pointless if you have to debug a program on a server.</li>
<li>You can enable &quot;core dumps&quot; on your OS, and when a program crashes
you'll get a core file.  This core file is like a post-mortem of
the program so you can load up what happened right at the crash
and see what caused it.  Change <tt class="docutils literal">ex31.c</tt> so that it crashes
after a few iterations, then try to get a core dump and analyze it.</li>
